My team's submission to the nwHacks 2022 Hackathon, this project is fully functional but is nowhere near production ready due to glaring UI flaws which we didn't have time to fix due to time constraints. The goal of this project is to visualize your strengths and weaknesses when it comes to solving Data Structures, the main page includes various bar graphs for each Data Structure so you can visually see where your strengths and weakness lie. We created this site as feature we would like to see implented on LeetCode, they allow you to view the questions you have solved but not in such an organized manner.
